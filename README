Moped Rails 3 Instrumentation
=============================

Records how long your rails app spends in Mongo (via Moped), and outputs it to the log, i.e.:

    Completed 200 OK in 1535ms (Views: 623.3ms | Mongo: 848.2ms)

To use, just add the gem to your Gemfile and restart your app:

    gem 'moped-rails-instrumentation', '~>0.1'

It's been tested with rails 3.0, and should work with rails 3.1 too.

This gem is based on mongo-rails-instrumentation by Tom Ward, available at https://github.com/freerange/mongo-rails-instrumentation and then ported to Moped by Stan Mazurek at https://github.com/stan/mongo-rails-instrumentation. It is released here by me only to provide a gem.
